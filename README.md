# BasicNeuralNetJava
Implement a very basic neural network using Java

I have developed this program by referring to this blog by David Miller: http://www.millermattson.com/dave/?p=54
David have given excellent explanations, so you can refer to the video for any doubs or questions.
The original implementation by David is in cpp, I have used Java which makes things easier for me.
